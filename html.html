  <h1>HTML
Week two of Kode with Klossy starts off with a BIG smack in the face: HTML. Google says that HTML is a “Hypertext Markup Language, a standardized system for tagging text files to achieve font, color, graphic, and hyperlink effects on World Wide Web pages”, but we really see it as web designing. It’s a lot to learn in only one day, however in just this day we learned how to create this website. Crazy, right?
