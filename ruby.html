  <h1>In week one of Kode with Klossy, we learned the basics of Ruby and also how to use the command-line. Throughout the week, there were some easy parts, but there were others that caused me to be in the panic zone for a while. Week One was full of coding and labs dealing with Ruby, but at the end of each day, I managed to pull through with  partners that kept me in check. For the labs, you are allowed to do as many as you want, and you are also allowed to choose the difficulty. Learning Ruby as my first coding language was very frustrating, but with the help of the teachers and TAS at Kode with Klossy, there’s nothing you can’t code!!!
